# About me
# Hi, I’m Tyler 👋

I’m a backend-focused software engineer transitioning from mechanical engineering, with hands-on experience designing, deploying, and owning **production database-driven systems end-to-end**. I build software the same way I approach engineering problems: start with solid foundations, model the system carefully, and optimize for correctness, maintainability, and long-term use.

My background includes independently designing and maintaining a **MySQL-based ERP system used daily by 100+ users** in an environment with no in-house software engineering support. That experience shaped how I think about backend systems, data modeling, APIs, and reliability under real-world constraints.

## 🧠 What I Focus On

- Backend and data-centric software engineering
- Relational database design and normalization
- API development and backend architecture
- Systems thinking and algorithmic problem-solving
- Writing clear, maintainable, well-structured code

---

## 🛠️ Technical Skills

**Languages**
- Python
- Rust
- SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- JavaScript
- HTML / CSS

**Frameworks & Tools**
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- Alembic
- React / Node.js / Express
- Tkinter (Python GUI)
- Iced (Rust GUI)

**Backend & Systems**
- REST API design
- Authentication & authorization concepts
- Linux (Debian-based systems)
- Git & GitHub
- Debugging, testing, and documentation

## 🚀 Selected Projects

- **DispatchDesk** — *FastAPI / PostgreSQL*  
  Backend ticketing and work-order system with role-based permissions, JWT auth, schema migrations, and OpenAPI documentation.

- **Internal ERP System** — *Python / MySQL (Production)*  
  Designed and deployed a normalized MySQL backend with stored procedures, reporting views, and a Python desktop GUI, fully owned and maintained solo.

- **Sudoku Solver** — *Rust / Petgraph*  
  Graph-based constraint solver using backtracking (DFS), MRV heuristics, and aggressive constraint propagation.

- **Codenames Helper** — *Rust / Iced*  
  Cross-platform desktop GUI demonstrating clean separation between backend state logic and UI rendering.

## 🎯 What I’m Looking For

I’m currently targeting **junior / associate software engineer**, **backend developer**, and **entry-level full-stack** roles where I can:
- Contribute to real production systems
- Grow under experienced engineers
- Work on well-designed, data-driven software

If you’re looking for an **engineer** with strong systems thinking, real ownership experience, and a proven ability to learn fast and ship responsibly, I’d love to connect.
